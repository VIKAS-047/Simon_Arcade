## Overview
The Simon Game is a memory game where the player has to repeat a sequence of colors that is generated by the game. The sequence gets longer each time the player successfully repeats it. If the player fails, the game ends.

## How to Play
1. When the game starts, the system will play a sequence of color flashes.
2. You need to repeat the sequence by clicking the colored blocks or pressing the corresponding keyboard keys (A, B, C, D).
3. Each time you correctly repeat the sequence, the game adds a new color to the sequence.
4. If you make a mistake, the game will show a "Game Over" message, and you can start a new game by pressing "O" or clicking "Play."
